01 Classes and Objects
02 Encapsulation
03 Inheritance
04 Polymorphism
05 Abstraction


- Encapsulation – Protects an object's data by restricting direct access and exposing only necessary functionality.
- Example: Using private variables and public getter/setter methods in a class.

- Explain Access Modifiers
    - Public (public) – Accessible from anywhere in the program.
    - Private (private) – Accessible only within the same class.
    - Protected (protected) – Accessible within the same package and by subclasses.
    - Default (No Modifier) – Accessible only within the same package.

Key Takeaways
✔ Public → Open to all.
✔ Private → Hidden inside the class.
✔ Protected → Shared with subclasses. (Inheritance)
✔ Default → Limited to the package.
Default vs parameterized constructors  

Getters and Setters
- Inheritance – Enables a child class to inherit properties and behaviors from a parent class, promoting code reuse.
- Example: A subclass inheriting from a superclass.

- Polymorphism – Allows objects to take many forms, making code flexible and reusable.
- Example: Overriding methods in a subclass.

- Abstraction – Hides complex implementation details and only exposes essential functionalities.
- Example: Abstract classes or interfaces in Java.
